# crypto-ds
A project made for the Introduction to Data Science (2020) course. Trying to find profitable models for cryptocurrency trading.

We forked code from the project we did last year in OOP, because we generate data using this project and we will test the models with tradingbots functionality in the end, so it made the most sense.
